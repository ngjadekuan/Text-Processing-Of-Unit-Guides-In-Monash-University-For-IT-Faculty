<title> Research methods in biology</title>
<synopsis>'Biological data is inherently variable. It is essential therefore that modern biologists be able to assemble and analyse these data to make important scientific advances. This unit will provide students with the framework to understand biological information, to test hypotheses, and to design robust experiments in biology. The ability to critique the methods used by scientific studies, make inferences from quantitative data, and optimize experimental approaches will benefit students taking a wide range of research and project-based units. Focus will be placed on interpreting and evaluating studies from the scientific literature and communicating biological findings to a range of audiences. This unit is a prerequisite unit for Honours in Biology and Genetics (BIO4100 and BIO4200).'</synopsis>

<title> Encounters and empire: Europe and the world</title>
<synopsis>"From the medieval period onwards, expansion brought Europeans increasingly into contact with diverse cultures and civilizations. This unit explores how encounters between Europe and the world were transformed from the tentative and uncertain contacts that characterised earlier periods to the self-confident imperialism of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Rather than analysing the broad sweep of political history, we are interested in the leading edge of cross-cultural encounters: in travellers, diplomats, and slaves who 'crossed-over' to engage with new cultural worlds, in the tools that made these encounters possible and in the commodities that underpinned global exchange."</synopsis>

<title> Twentieth-century Britain: Rule Britannia to cool Britannia</title>
<synopsis>"Over the course of the twentieth century, Britain underwent massive political, social and economic transformation. In 1900 the country controlled the largest empire in the history of the world, but two world wars, a depression, decolonization, rapid deindustrialization, as well as major civil and industrial unrest meant that by the 1970s Britain was in serious decline, in some ways the 'sick man of Europe'. Recent years have seen a major revival in its fortunes and influence on the world stage. Drawing on a range of sources, including art, literature and popular culture, this unit traces the story of the rise, decline and re-emergence of the country across a century of rapid change."</synopsis>

<title> Modern Italian political thought</title>
<synopsis>"The unit surveys Italian political thought &amp; practice from the Renaissance to the New Millennium. It aims to give students a clear understanding of modern &amp; contemporary Italian political ideas, culture and institutions. It begins by examining Italian political thinkers, diplomats, and activists' seminal contribution to Renaissance, Enlightenment and Modern political theories and movements. It then shows how Italian political thinkers shaped the competing ideologies at the heart of twentieth century Europe's crises &amp; revolutions: Liberalism, Marxism and Fascism.  It will focus on one of Prato's most famous citizens, political theorist, diplomat, journalist, novelist and director Curzio Malaparte, whose life and work is a microcosm of these ideological disputes. It takes students to the present day by studying the rise and fall of Italy's First Republic (1948-1992) and its consensus democracy; the birth of the Second Republic (1992-), with its hopes for rebuilding Italian democratic institutions and civic culture in the context of endemic political corruption; and the recent emergence of Italian populist, anti-European Union movements."</synopsis>

<title> Leaders, power and politics</title>
<synopsis>"Leadership is indispensable to politics. Yet leadership is a problematic concept within liberal democracies that have traditionally set out to devolve authority and check against concentrations of power. This unit explores political leadership within liberal democracies using Australia (prime ministers) and the United States (presidents) as its primary empirical reference points. It examines how political leadership has been theorised from classical to contemporary times, including the application of psychology to understand the motivations and classify the behavioural repertoires of leaders. The unit considers how leaders are constrained by context ('the times') and institutional settings. It asks whether leaders make history or are prisoners of it and why certain leaders become associated with transformative change. The unit also explores two of the fundamental functions of political leaders: persuasion and decision-making. It investigates whether it is possible to identify the qualities of successful political leadership. Finally, the unit takes stock of political leadership in the early twenty-first century: an era in which leaders have never seemed more central to politics and yet the challenges of leadership so great. Students will be given the opportunity to choose a leader on which to focus to explore the themes addressed in the unit."</synopsis>

<title> Religion, philosophy, science</title>
<synopsis>'Religion, philosophy and science are three modes of thinking about the world and understanding the role humanity plays in it. Often considered to be separate and competing fields of human inquiry, throughout history they often overlapped and complemented each other. Babylonians were keen observes of the celestial phenomena, but their interest in astronomy was religiously motivated. In a similar manner Plato was a philosopher, but his teachings gave rise to Neoplatonism which was both a philosophical and religious system, moreover one which in medieval times led to alchemy, the beginnings of modern chemistry.  This unit familiarises students with the differences and similarities, convergences and departures between religious, philosophical and scientific ways of thinking, key past debates between them and the impact religion has had on the development of philosophy and science. Finally, the unit also offers a critical insight into current issues involving intelligent design, creationism, evolution and Darwinism; quantum physics, matter, causation, divine action and free will; neuroscience and religious experience; and various bioethical dilemmas arising from advancement in technology and medicine.'</synopsis>

<title> State sovereignty, human rights, and the responsibility to protect</title>
<synopsis>"Despite its recent inception, the doctrine of 'Responsibility to Protect' (RtP) is now a central part of international political efforts to prevent genocidal violence. RtP rejects a traditional view of absolute state sovereignty, and is instead based on the idea that states are only sovereign so long as they don't perpetrate or allow extreme human rights abuses. In this unit we begin by surveying the recent history of RtP as a guiding framework in international politics, and considering some of the challenges that have arisen around its implementation. We then investigate four sets of questions related to RtP, with both theoretical and practical aspects. First, is RtP a way for powerful nations to exert control over vulnerable nations? Second, are there reasons to doubt the effectiveness of RtP in achieving its aims? Third, what implications does the emergence of RtP have for how we understand the philosophical nature of human rights? Fourth, what are RtP's implications in relation to growing refugee crises in the 21st century?."</synopsis>

<title> Introduction to dietetic skills</title>
<synopsis>"This unit uses chronic disease as the foundations and basis for dietetic students to develop their core dietetic practice assessment, counselling and management skills.  There is an emphasis on person centred care and simulation provides a key platform for learning in this unit. A formative Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) sits within this unit to assist students' readiness for placement. Students are introduced to the healthcare system and a range of health care settings via an introductory clinical placement. This aims to commence the application of the nutrition care process, the use of food as a therapeutic tool, clinical reasoning, reflection and advanced communication and interpersonal skills required for dietetic practice. Attendance at this placement is compulsory. This unit supports students' progression towards entry level competencies in individual case management in the healthcare setting. Placement may take place outside of regular semester times. Students must have valid police check, WWC check and immunisation certificates in order to participate in clinical placements"</synopsis>

<synopsis>"Europe is the birthplace of cinema, and from the silent era through to Italian neo-realism, to the new waves of the 1960s and 70s, European cinema changed the way we see and know the world. In this unit we trace the development of European cinema after the fall of the Berlin Wall and into the 21st century, asking three key questions: How have the changing boundaries and social crises in Europe in the post-Berlin Wall era impacted on cinema? What distinguishes European cinema from others in the global era? Can the cinema still be an appropriate media for reflecting cultures, identity and social change? We will study some of Europe's most influential contemporary films and documentaries. We will examine the tension between the rise of transnational European 'blockbuster' cinema, designed to compete with Hollywood, and traditional European art house filmmaking. We will consider the long-standing relationship between European cinema and the European tradition of film festivals. We will address issues of language, translation and subtitling. And we will also look at political and social implications of important emergent cinemas from this period, including a proliferation of immigrant films that are challenging traditional conceptions of European space and identity. Students will be introduced to films from a range of countries, including France, Belgium, Italy, Germany, Hungary and Spain."</synopsis>

<title> Cultural diversity in contemporary Europe</title>
<synopsis>"The unit, presented over a four week period, involves a research-led case study of cultural diversity in Europe. Based at Monash University's Prato Centre, students will be introduced to the main overarching theories concerning migration and cultural diversity. Within these overarching theories, students will also encounter numerous concepts and perspectives including among others, cosmopolitanism, assimilation, integration, multiculturalism, insider-outsider relations and the notion of 'othering'. Issues relating to race, culture, identity and citizenship will also be considered. The uniqueness of the unit and its relevance to the Prato setting is that students will use these theoretical underpinnings to frame a case study involving observational research to complete 3000 word case study concerning managing cultural diversity in Europe. Students will be encouraged to observe cultural similarities and differences, and particularly the interactions between different cultural groups. The unit aims to provide understandings of managing cultural diversity and a unique experience in undertaking observational research in a European setting. While the topic is a core focus and one of the research strengths in Sociology, it will appeal to students in a range of disciplines including those interested in international relations, law, criminology and Bachelor of Arts students in general."</synopsis>

Identified by UNESCO as an environment and cultural landscape worth preserving, the region is under immense pressure due to climate change, rural depopulation, abandonment of agricultural lands, landscape instability, and burgeoning tourism. Problems of integrating tourism and agricultural objectives, while minimising negative environmental and cultural impacts, will be explored and possible solutions for regional sustainability proposed. The unit provides unique opportunities for interaction with staff of the National Park and various local and national authorities.'</synopsis>

<title> Tropical meteorology</title>
<synopsis>"Tropical weather is very different from that in the mid and higher latitudes. For example, compared with the mid and higher latitudes, temperature and pressure gradients are (mostly) very weak in the tropics.  This unit describes the key properties of the tropical atmosphere and explains the science underpinning tropical climate and weather.  The governing equations of motion are introduced and the approximations relevant to the tropics described and justified.  The most important of these approximations, and the fundamental reason for the differences between the tropics and the mid and higher latitudes, is that the effect of the earth's rotation (as expressed through the Coriolis force) is small in the tropics.  Another important distinction between the tropics and elsewhere is that the atmosphere is more strongly coupled to the ocean.  The approximated equations of motion will be used to explain the Hadley circulation, equatorial waves and the El Nino - Southern Oscillation, and these explanations compared in detail with observation.  Unlike the midlatitudes, moist convection is essential in understanding the weather and climate of the tropics.  For this reason emphasis will be placed on the parts played by convection and radiation in driving the large-scale circulation and in producing locally important weather.  The unit concludes with an examination of tropical cyclones, perhaps the most destructive weather system on the planet."</synopsis>

<title> State sovereignty, human rights, and the responsibility to protect</title>
<synopsis>"Despite its recent inception, the doctrine of 'Responsibility to Protect' (RtP) is now a central part of international political efforts to prevent genocidal violence. RtP rejects a traditional view of absolute state sovereignty, and is instead based on the idea that states are only sovereign so long as they don't perpetrate or allow extreme human rights abuses. In this unit we begin by surveying the recent history of RtP as a guiding framework in international politics, and considering some of the challenges that have arisen around its implementation. We then investigate four sets of questions related to RtP, with both theoretical and practical aspects. First, is RtP a way for powerful nations to exert control over vulnerable nations? Second, are there reasons to doubt the effectiveness of RtP in achieving its aims? Third, what implications does the emergence of RtP have for how we understand the philosophical nature of human rights? Fourth, what are RtP's implications in relation to growing refugee crises in the 21st century?."</synopsis>

<synopsis>'This unit will provide students with insights into the role of emerging economies in a globalising world. Using a political economy approach, the unit will provide a comparative perspective on Brazil, Russia, China, India and South Africa also known as the BRICS. Over the past ten years the geo-political and economic importance of the BRICS has been increasing. While they have been advocating for a stronger voice in major international institutions such as the WTO, the World Bank and the IMF, the BRICS do not have a common identity and their influence and power at the global level is uneven. This unit covers the history of the BRICS as well as the political, economic, security and foreign policy trends in these countries. It provides different perspectives on the power of the BRICS in an international context and focuses on the challenges they face. Particular attention is given to the thematic areas of international trade, international finance, the environment, global health and food security.'</synopsis>

<title> Imagining Ibero-America: Travels, texts and transnational encounters</title>
<synopsis>"This unit examines the ways in which Spain and Latin America have represented each other, and the 'singular cultural space' of Ibero-America, at critical junctures during the twentieth century. Through a range of sources produced on both sides of the Atlantic, including works of fiction, critical essays, travel narratives, journalism and film, the unit reflects on the supranational contexts in which (trans)national identities are negotiated and defined. Students explore such critical issues as notions of nationhood and 'race,' cosmopolitanism, immigration and exile, gender and subjectivity, and the confrontation of modernity with tradition. As a point of departure, students are introduced to the idea of Hispanidad and the ideology of Hispanoamericanism as a means by which Spain sought its national regeneration by proclaiming the shared spirit, language and culture that allegedly unites Spain and its former colonies. One of the recurring themes explored are the various responses to this idea of Ibero-America as a homogenous cultural space. Students will reassess critically the nature of post-imperial Spain and post-colonial Latin America from the aftermath of Spain's loss of empire in 1898 to the rapid increase in Latin American immigration to Spain at the end of the twentieth century."</synopsis>

<title> The emergence of modern Ireland</title>
<synopsis>"The unit explores the emergence of a modern Anglo-Irish literary canon, from the years preceding the foundation of the Free State in 1922 to contemporary works. Writers have felt compelled to define Irish identity in response to crises, from the agitation to achieve independence from British rule, and reactions to the exertion of power by the Catholic Church, to the more recent financial collapse, and debate over reproductive rights. Under such pressures, authors innovated in diverse ways. Yeats sought a mystical system of symbols, while Beckett turned to the absurd. Joyce interrogated the possibilities of language, while Mhac an tSaoi articulated the affinity between the artist's struggle with tradition and the challenges faced by women in Irish society. Heaney and Kinsella were among those who both responded to contemporary events explicitly and reached into ancient legend for material to help ascertain what type of narrative might be considered characteristically Irish. Considering this search for identity in literary forms such as poetry, drama, the short story, and the essay - and addressing receptions of this heritage in film, popular song, and graphic novels - the unit explores a century of self-definition in a culture that constitutes a significant area of literary studies, and that has a rich tradition of exchange with Australia."</synopsis>

They practice expressing these things through drawing and the exploration of abstract interpretations in card, paper and foam. Early explorations of the same in a simple form of CAD (e.g. Google sketch-up). Cardboard structures are built to explore early understanding of structure balance and geometry in static objects. This unit explores the nature of design by introducing the characteristics of space, objects or images as appropriate, as part of a designer's repertoire of knowledge and understanding. Basic design studies provide the framework for the development of a language of design."</synopsis>

<title> Philosophy of war and global conflict</title>
<synopsis>'The unit adopts a global perspective but looks at issues through a South African and African lens. We examine questions such as: When, if ever, is warfare justified? What about humanitarian intervention? What about violent revolution and terrorism? Why should civilians be protected in conflict? These issues are linked to the situation in Africa, with particular reference to some of the vexing dilemmas encountered within this context, such as terrorism, dictatorships and civil war. This unit will introduce students to theoretical approaches to the ethics of conflict that will allow them to answer these difficult questions. It will also serve to introduce students to basic ideas in moral and political philosophy. No background in philosophy is required: merely an interest in rational argument applied to global conflict.'</synopsis>

<synopsis>"The post-2000 era has seen radical transformations in the way television is produced, distributed, viewed and valued. This unit traces the development of one of the most visible and successful outcomes of these shifts, global long-form television series that experiment boldly with complex serial narratives, self-conscious stylistics and provocative themes and characters. Areas for discussion include the millennial industrial developments that enable these series to be produced, the critical discourses of 'quality' television that construct their artistic status, the transnational markets in which they circulate, and the audiences and fans that give them a cult life beyond the screen. Through examination of how these systems and strategies both break with and continue historical televisual traditions, the unit demonstrates how the long-form mode of storytelling exemplifies the cultural form of television as the most vital and influential of the millennial era."</synopsis>

<title> Language, culture and society on the Korean Peninsula</title>
<synopsis>'The unit critically examines language, culture and society on the Korean Peninsula. The first half of the unit adopts a socio-historical perspective to look at the emergence of linguistic and cultural practices in Korea against the backdrop of over 2,000 years of history, starting with the Three Kingdoms period (57BC-666AD) and culminating with the annexation of Korea by Japan (1910-1945). The second half of the unit focuses on language and culture in the post-war societies of North and South Korea. The unit introduces major developments in the formation, distribution and projection of languages on the Korean peninsula, as well as accompanying cultural and historical changes in historical and contemporary Korea. Through specially prepared online materials, students will also learn basic facts about Korean history. The unit will provide students with the tools to look objectively at how language reflects the society we live in, and how language itself becomes an important marker of cultural identity. An important goal in the unit will be to get away from a monolithic view of Korean language and culture and encourage students to engage in critical analysis of the inevitable variation and change that characterizes linguistic and cultural practices. Through a variety of reading materials, students will be exposed to different approaches for analyzing language, culture and society. The unit will be conducted in English and will be open to students without any specific competence in Korean.'</synopsis>

<synopsis>'The foundations of continuum analysis of fluids will be presented. Using control volume analysis the fundamental conservation laws for mass, momentum and energy are developed leading to the derivation of the Navier-Stokes equations. Techniques employed to solving these equations for specific problems are explored. Methods of exact and approximate solutions of these equations, and the use of conceptual and analytical tools such as flow similitude, vorticity, circulation, stream function and velocity potential are described. The concept of boundary layers and its use in the calculation of drag and lift forces is elucidated. The origins and physical consequences of the phenomenon of fluid turbulence are discussed, along with their implications for computation of turbulent flows. The analysis of compressible flows and its applications are discussed.

<title> Stardom: Celebrity, society and power</title>
<synopsis>"Since the early 20th century film stars have been a central feature of cinema and have attained a prominent place within broader culture and society. They appear in magazines, on billboards, on television programmes, and now have a strong presence on the internet. The importance of stars stems from their economic function within cinema, their contributions to the meanings and affects of films, and their ideological role in defining and shaping popular conceptions of identity in societies at particular points in time. This course will offer a thorough interrogation of the star phenomenon, combining theoretical work derived from the field of 'star studies' with empirical analyses of specific films and stars. A host of extra-filmic materials, such as magazine articles, interviews, film reviews and promotional materials will also be analysed as students seek to identity the defining features of a number of star personas. Topics covered will include the history of stardom from the silent 'gods and goddesses' to modern day television stars and celebrity culture; the ideological role of stars in circulating and revealing dominant attitudes to class, gender, sexuality and race/ethnicity; and the cultural and national specificities of stardom through case studies of American, French, Indian and Southeast Asian stars. In doing so, there will be emphasis on the contribution stars make to the pleasures of cinema, while remaining attentive to the political implications of these hugely popular and highly influential representations of selfhood."</synopsis>

In many cases, this era has seen the breakdown of the classical Islamic paradigms of governance, leadership, learning, and social order, and the consequent development of new Islamic or Islamist ideologies and movements. Examples will be considered from both Sunni and Shi'ite perspectives across diverse landscapes. The lives and works of significant figures in modern Islamic history will be studied in order to understand the diversity of the ways in which Islamic thought has responded to the colonial and post-colonial age. The course introduces the pre-colonial background of the Mughal, Ottoman, and Safavid Empires, before moving to the colonial encounters, state reforms and emerging ideologies in the nineteenth century. The course provides an up-to-date introduction to various Muslim movements in the colonial and post-colonial period.

<synopsis>'The unit aims at assisting students towards an informed understanding of how masculinities are understood and enacted in Asia (Singapore, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, India, Bangladesh, South Korea, Japan), Africa (Uganda, Sub-Saharan Africa, Ethiopia), and in the United States. Scholars note that a more holistic approach to Gender Studies must take into serious consideration the meanings and relationalities between femininities and masculinities, particularly in the ways in which these synergies manifest diversely around the globe. Inspired by the insights of the celebrated masculinities scholar Raewyn Connell, this unit challenges flattened impressions of masculinity as universal, singular manifestations, and invites students to consider the unstable constructions of masculinities in relation to femininities and other intersecting issues. This eye-opening unit covers topics such as patriarchy and violence, military, spiritualities, non-heteronormative sexualities, disease, marriage, cooking, racism and female masculinities. Through a close examination of highly diverse and exciting resources, students will engage with and understand the complex and shifting performances of masculinities that impact men (and women) in Asia, Africa and the United States.'</synopsis>

This enables students to evaluate how well their designs match up to particular technical and cultural requirements. Students will be expected to develop their own design proposals. Topics cover advanced aspects of 3D modelling and production processes in a variety of materials and the aesthetic aspects of transportation. Studio project work involves the development of a sophisticated piece of transportation design.'</synopsis>
