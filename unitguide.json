It aims to give students a clear understanding of modern &amp; contemporary Italian political ideas, culture and institutions. It begins by examining Italian political thinkers, diplomats, and activists' seminal contribution to Renaissance, Enlightenment and Modern political theories and movements. It then shows how Italian political thinkers shaped the competing ideologies at the heart of twentieth century Europe's crises &amp; revolutions: Liberalism, Marxism and Fascism.  It will focus on one of Prato's most famous citizens, political theorist, diplomat, journalist, novelist and director Curzio Malaparte, whose life and work is a microcosm of these ideological disputes. It takes students to the present day by studying the rise and fall of Italy's First Republic (1948-1992) and its consensus democracy; the birth of the Second Republic (1992-), with its hopes for rebuilding Italian democratic institutions and civic culture in the context of endemic political corruption; and the recent emergence of Italian populist, anti-European Union movements.\"]",

It examines how political leadership has been theorised from classical to contemporary times, including the application of psychology to understand the motivations and classify the behavioural repertoires of leaders. The unit considers how leaders are constrained by context ('the times') and institutional settings. It asks whether leaders make history or are prisoners of it and why certain leaders become associated with transformative change. The unit also explores two of the fundamental functions of political leaders: persuasion and decision-making. It investigates whether it is possible to identify the qualities of successful political leadership. Finally, the unit takes stock of political leadership in the early twenty-first century: an era in which leaders have never seemed more central to politics and yet the challenges of leadership so great. Students will be given the opportunity to choose a leader on which to focus to explore the themes addressed in the unit.\"]",

Often considered to be separate and competing fields of human inquiry, throughout history they often overlapped and complemented each other. Babylonians were keen observes of the celestial phenomena, but their interest in astronomy was religiously motivated. In a similar manner Plato was a philosopher, but his teachings gave rise to Neoplatonism which was both a philosophical and religious system, moreover one which in medieval times led to alchemy, the beginnings of modern chemistry.  This unit familiarises students with the differences and similarities, convergences and departures between religious, philosophical and scientific ways of thinking, key past debates between them and the impact religion has had on the development of philosophy and science. Finally, the unit also offers a critical insight into current issues involving intelligent design, creationism, evolution and Darwinism; quantum physics, matter, causation, divine action and free will; neuroscience and religious experience; and various bioethical dilemmas arising from advancement in technology and medicine.']",

RtP rejects a traditional view of absolute state sovereignty, and is instead based on the idea that states are only sovereign so long as they don't perpetrate or allow extreme human rights abuses. In this unit we begin by surveying the recent history of RtP as a guiding framework in international politics, and considering some of the challenges that have arisen around its implementation. We then investigate four sets of questions related to RtP, with both theoretical and practical aspects. First, is RtP a way for powerful nations to exert control over vulnerable nations? Second, are there reasons to doubt the effectiveness of RtP in achieving its aims? Third, what implications does the emergence of RtP have for how we understand the philosophical nature of human rights? Fourth, what are RtP's implications in relation to growing refugee crises in the 21st century?.\"]",

The unit will then engage in a more detailed discussion of the actual transitional justice mechanisms before moving on to consider a number of case studies in order to ground students\\' understanding of the subject matter in concrete examples. In addition to exploring the transitional justice programs implemented in different countries, the unit will also engage in a comparative analysis of the various case studies and will examine a number of cross-cutting themes, such as gender and transitional justice.']",

In this unit we trace the development of European cinema after the fall of the Berlin Wall and into the 21st century, asking three key questions: How have the changing boundaries and social crises in Europe in the post-Berlin Wall era impacted on cinema? What distinguishes European cinema from others in the global era? Can the cinema still be an appropriate media for reflecting cultures, identity and social change? We will study some of Europe's most influential contemporary films and documentaries. We will examine the tension between the rise of transnational European 'blockbuster' cinema, designed to compete with Hollywood, and traditional European art house filmmaking. We will consider the long-standing relationship between European cinema and the European tradition of film festivals. We will address issues of language, translation and subtitling. And we will also look at political and social implications of important emergent cinemas from this period, including a proliferation of immigrant films that are challenging traditional conceptions of European space and identity. Students will be introduced to films from a range of countries, including France, Belgium, Italy, Germany, Hungary and Spain.\"]",

Within these overarching theories, students will also encounter numerous concepts and perspectives including among others, cosmopolitanism, assimilation, integration, multiculturalism, insider-outsider relations and the notion of 'othering'. Issues relating to race, culture, identity and citizenship will also be considered. The uniqueness of the unit and its relevance to the Prato setting is that students will use these theoretical underpinnings to frame a case study involving observational research to complete 3000 word case study concerning managing cultural diversity in Europe. Students will be encouraged to observe cultural similarities and differences, and particularly the interactions between different cultural groups. The unit aims to provide understandings of managing cultural diversity and a unique experience in undertaking observational research in a European setting. While the topic is a core focus and one of the research strengths in Sociology, it will appeal to students in a range of disciplines including those interested in international relations, law, criminology and Bachelor of Arts students in general.\"]",

Fraud examination is the process used to resolve allegations of fraud through the accumulation of evidence, including the investigation of systems and internal controls, and the detection of fraud circumstances. The unit examines the investigative process as well as an array of tools and techniques used to investigate financial forensic issues and fraud. Topics include: methods and techniques used by forensic accountants to collect, analyse and report relevant information for supporting cases to be presented in court; the nature, prevention, detection and investigation of different types of fraud, including: financial statement fraud, fraud against the organisation, consumer fraud, and e-commerce fraud.']",

Students will gain valuable community engagement and participation experience through structured volunteer placements within strategically selected private, public and indigenous health related settings. Students will actively participate within these facilities in all aspects of the care programs being delivered allowing them to develop communication, listening and teamwork and skills whilst acquiring an insight into community health issues. In addition students will explore the valuable role they play as health care professionals in educating the community about the paramedics' role, and contributing to patient understanding of medical emergencies and the range of health care services and options available to them. Finally, through their community participation students will be expected to identify real or perceived gaps within the community health sector and devise strategies to narrow those gaps and achieve better health outcomes.\"]",

For example, compared with the mid and higher latitudes, temperature and pressure gradients are (mostly) very weak in the tropics.  This unit describes the key properties of the tropical atmosphere and explains the science underpinning tropical climate and weather.  The governing equations of motion are introduced and the approximations relevant to the tropics described and justified.  The most important of these approximations, and the fundamental reason for the differences between the tropics and the mid and higher latitudes, is that the effect of the earth's rotation (as expressed through the Coriolis force) is small in the tropics.  Another important distinction between the tropics and elsewhere is that the atmosphere is more strongly coupled to the ocean.  The approximated equations of motion will be used to explain the Hadley circulation, equatorial waves and the El Nino - Southern Oscillation, and these explanations compared in detail with observation.  Unlike the midlatitudes, moist convection is essential in understanding the weather and climate of the tropics.  For this reason emphasis will be placed on the parts played by convection and radiation in driving the large-scale circulation and in producing locally important weather.  The unit concludes with an examination of tropical cyclones, perhaps the most destructive weather system on the planet.\"]",

RtP rejects a traditional view of absolute state sovereignty, and is instead based on the idea that states are only sovereign so long as they don't perpetrate or allow extreme human rights abuses. In this unit we begin by surveying the recent history of RtP as a guiding framework in international politics, and considering some of the challenges that have arisen around its implementation. We then investigate four sets of questions related to RtP, with both theoretical and practical aspects. First, is RtP a way for powerful nations to exert control over vulnerable nations? Second, are there reasons to doubt the effectiveness of RtP in achieving its aims? Third, what implications does the emergence of RtP have for how we understand the philosophical nature of human rights? Fourth, what are RtP's implications in relation to growing refugee crises in the 21st century?.\"]",

These principles are used to analyse and discuss a variety of broad ethical issues which arise in patient care, such as the allocation of health care resources, the justifiability of paternalism, breaches of patient confidentiality, in vitro fertilisation, and euthanasia. There is also some discussion of the role of health professionals, in relation to conscientious refusals to treat patients, and issues in family care giving.\"]",

Using a political economy approach, the unit will provide a comparative perspective on Brazil, Russia, China, India and South Africa also known as the BRICS. Over the past ten years the geo-political and economic importance of the BRICS has been increasing. While they have been advocating for a stronger voice in major international institutions such as the WTO, the World Bank and the IMF, the BRICS do not have a common identity and their influence and power at the global level is uneven. This unit covers the history of the BRICS as well as the political, economic, security and foreign policy trends in these countries. It provides different perspectives on the power of the BRICS in an international context and focuses on the challenges they face. Particular attention is given to the thematic areas of international trade, international finance, the environment, global health and food security.']",

To follow, students attend an intensive workshop at Monash University (Caulfield) to develop skills in research design, methods, analysis and project management. Students will travel to New York to learn first hand how newsrooms are adapting to change. How have outlets responded to the pressures of changing consumption patterns, delivery platforms and business models? What is it like to be a media practitioner in the contemporary era? How are news values shifting to capture contemporary audiences? And are the foundations of journalism in a liberal democracy - notions of independence, objectivity and fairness - changing too?

Through a range of sources produced on both sides of the Atlantic, including works of fiction, critical essays, travel narratives, journalism and film, the unit reflects on the supranational contexts in which (trans)national identities are negotiated and defined. Students explore such critical issues as notions of nationhood and 'race,' cosmopolitanism, immigration and exile, gender and subjectivity, and the confrontation of modernity with tradition. As a point of departure, students are introduced to the idea of Hispanidad and the ideology of Hispanoamericanism as a means by which Spain sought its national regeneration by proclaiming the shared spirit, language and culture that allegedly unites Spain and its former colonies. One of the recurring themes explored are the various responses to this idea of Ibero-America as a homogenous cultural space. Students will reassess critically the nature of post-imperial Spain and post-colonial Latin America from the aftermath of Spain's loss of empire in 1898 to the rapid increase in Latin American immigration to Spain at the end of the twentieth century.\"]",

Writers have felt compelled to define Irish identity in response to crises, from the agitation to achieve independence from British rule, and reactions to the exertion of power by the Catholic Church, to the more recent financial collapse, and debate over reproductive rights. Under such pressures, authors innovated in diverse ways. Yeats sought a mystical system of symbols, while Beckett turned to the absurd. Joyce interrogated the possibilities of language, while Mhac an tSaoi articulated the affinity between the artist's struggle with tradition and the challenges faced by women in Irish society. Heaney and Kinsella were among those who both responded to contemporary events explicitly and reached into ancient legend for material to help ascertain what type of narrative might be considered characteristically Irish. Considering this search for identity in literary forms such as poetry, drama, the short story, and the essay - and addressing receptions of this heritage in film, popular song, and graphic novels - the unit explores a century of self-definition in a culture that constitutes a significant area of literary studies, and that has a rich tradition of exchange with Australia.\"]",

Areas for discussion include the millennial industrial developments that enable these series to be produced, the critical discourses of 'quality' television that construct their artistic status, the transnational markets in which they circulate, and the audiences and fans that give them a cult life beyond the screen. Through examination of how these systems and strategies both break with and continue historical televisual traditions, the unit demonstrates how the long-form mode of storytelling exemplifies the cultural form of television as the most vital and influential of the millennial era.\"]",

The second half of the unit focuses on language and culture in the post-war societies of North and South Korea. The unit introduces major developments in the formation, distribution and projection of languages on the Korean peninsula, as well as accompanying cultural and historical changes in historical and contemporary Korea. Through specially prepared online materials, students will also learn basic facts about Korean history. The unit will provide students with the tools to look objectively at how language reflects the society we live in, and how language itself becomes an important marker of cultural identity. An important goal in the unit will be to get away from a monolithic view of Korean language and culture and encourage students to engage in critical analysis of the inevitable variation and change that characterizes linguistic and cultural practices. Through a variety of reading materials, students will be exposed to different approaches for analyzing language, culture and society. The unit will be conducted in English and will be open to students without any specific competence in Korean.']",

The concept of boundary layers and its use in the calculation of drag and lift forces is elucidated. The origins and physical consequences of the phenomenon of fluid turbulence are discussed, along with their implications for computation of turbulent flows.

The importance of stars stems from their economic function within cinema, their contributions to the meanings and affects of films, and their ideological role in defining and shaping popular conceptions of identity in societies at particular points in time. This course will offer a thorough interrogation of the star phenomenon, combining theoretical work derived from the field of 'star studies' with empirical analyses of specific films and stars. A host of extra-filmic materials, such as magazine articles, interviews, film reviews and promotional materials will also be analysed as students seek to identity the defining features of a number of star personas. Topics covered will include the history of stardom from the silent 'gods and goddesses' to modern day television stars and celebrity culture; the ideological role of stars in circulating and revealing dominant attitudes to class, gender, sexuality and race/ethnicity; and the cultural and national specificities of stardom through case studies of American, French, Indian and Southeast Asian stars. In doing so, there will be emphasis on the contribution stars make to the pleasures of cinema, while remaining attentive to the political implications of these hugely popular and highly influential representations of selfhood.\"]",

Social work research is seen to be informed by a clear value base and driven to deliver socially constructive outcomes. The unit will explore research processes, presenting a structured approach to the implementation of a research proposal. There will be particular emphasis on research in practice, program evaluation,  and program development, as well as the ethical underpinnings of all research. The overall aim of this unit is to encourage students to become critically reflective, research minded practitioners, who contribute in an ongoing way to the knowledge base of the profession. Students will engage in a range of learning activities, including interactive lectures, workshops, cross-disciplinary masterclasses and integrated online learning. Students will focus on learning the language and terminology of research, within a reflective practice framework.']",

Inspired by the insights of the celebrated masculinities scholar Raewyn Connell, this unit challenges flattened impressions of masculinity as universal, singular manifestations, and invites students to consider the unstable constructions of masculinities in relation to femininities and other intersecting issues. This eye-opening unit covers topics such as patriarchy and violence, military, spiritualities, non-heteronormative sexualities, disease, marriage, cooking, racism and female masculinities. Through a close examination of highly diverse and exciting resources, students will engage with and understand the complex and shifting performances of masculinities that impact men (and women) in Asia, Africa and the United States.']",
