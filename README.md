# Text-Processing-Of-Unit-Guides-In-Monash-University-For-IT-Faculty



Programming Language: Python

In this project, I've analysed the unit guides for Information Technology faculty of Monash. The text was extracted in the form of a text file. From this text file, I've utilised regular expression to extract unit code, unit title, prerequisites, prohibitions, synopsis, outcomes, requirements and chief examiners of the units. The output was then extracted in the form of xml and json file. 

I've also analysed the details of units provided by Monash University which was available in a pdf file. This pdf file contains details of the title, synopsis and outcomes from the units taught. Preprocessing was performed on the textual data and a vocab file was produced.
